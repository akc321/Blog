            </div>
            <p>Modern business is developing vastly, leaving businesses who do not implement it in dangerous territory. It can gain a large advantage for the companies who do use it which can help those businesses to both survive and grow.</p>
            <p>It has uses such as keeping financial information updated, marketing products and services to customers, monitoring trends, improving efficiency and effectiveness, organising the business, it can essentially be used in every aspect of a company to help improve it and create more value.</p>

            <h2>Methods & skills</h2>
            </div>
            <p>There are a multitude of methods and skills required to complete a digital project successfully. We can decide on these once we break down the project into individual tasks needed to complete each section. </p>
            <p>First we will need to discover the problem or need involved with each task. This will lead us to the skills and tools required. As many options will be available to perform each task we will need to decide which will benefit the project greatest and is within the projects budget, whether using them tools fits within the projects time constraints and whether the team we have has the skills required to use the tools needed.</p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Planning an IT project is a complicated task as there can be many components to completing a project. By breaking down each of these components into individual elements we are able to make the project more manageable and monitor how far we are getting. Tools such as Trello can be used to do this. You can see an example of how I have used Trello to break down the task of creating this document here -
            <a href=https://trello.com/b/84huiwsC/project-1>Link to trello</a></p>
            <p>Whilst creating a plan all goals should be measurable. A framework for this is SMART. By having SMART goals which stands for </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Specific (simple, sensible, significant).</li>
            <li>Measurable (meaningful, motivating).</li>
            <li>Achievable (agreed, attainable).</li>
            <li>Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).</li>
            <li>Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can assess how well we have done once the task is complete.</p>

            <h2>Risks</h2>
            </div>
            <p>As with any project there are risks involved. Risks involved with a digital project can be similar to that of non digital project, such as cost and time constraints. There are also risks which are specifically linked with digital projects such as cyber security and changes to an operating system.</p>
            <h3>Financial</h3>
            <p>Will the project go over budget? Is there something that we have not budgeted for? Can we afford to have any delays on the project.</p>
            <h3>Time Constraints</h3>
            <p>How long do we have to do the project? Is that possible with the time that we have? Do we have time if any delays happen due to issues out of anyones control?</p>
            <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
            <p>Is the data secure? Is everyone on the project following the correct protocol to keep their data secure? What is the damage if data is not kept secure?</p>
            <h3>Updates and Upgrades</h3>
            <p>Is the data secure? Is everyone on the project following the correct protocol to keep their data secure? What is the damage if data is not kept secure?</p>
            <h3>Poor Planning</h3>
            <p>Poor planning can lead to a whole host of issues with your digital project. If you do not plan each stage and try and discover any issues before the event, you could be left with having to go forward with a product you are not happy with or possibly delay a project. Good planning will simplify a project for your team (or yourself) making it easy to follow and not get lost in performing tasks which were never required. It will highlight if there are any knowledge gaps or if you require new tools to develop what is needed. It will also help to estimate the size, cost and time needed to complete the project.</p>

            <h2>Software Selection</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Choosing the correct software for a project can depend on a variety of factors, by assessing each of these factors we are able to narrow down which software is the best to perform the task using the resources that we have.</p>
            <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
            <p>First thing first, what is the problem or need? By evaluating this we can decide which type of software will be able to solve our problem or fulfil our need.</p>
            <h3>Skills of the team?</h3>
            <p>We then need to look at the people who will be using the software, what are there skills? do they have the time to learn a new skill? Would it be better to use software the are already comfortable with.</p>
            <h3>Is the software suitable?</h3>
            <p>There are lots of areas we need to look into when discussing the suitability of software. These include the difficulty to use, the difficulty to learn, how quickly you can write the data to perform the task, does it have any good features, is it efficient, will it be effective, how safe is your data when using this software, is it good value for money, will it work on different operating systems or different browsers and can it be implemented effectively.</p>
            <h3>Compare and eliminate</h3>
            <p>Once we have done all of the above we can then make a choice on which is going to be the best software for the project at hand. We can first eliminate any software which does not meet the requirements set out above. Secondly we can use parallel thinking which is a thinking process which helps groups make a decision. Instead of the traditional way of one person arguing for one way and another arguing the points for another way. In parallel thinking all positives and negative points are put forward by all parties for each software. After all points are on the table a judgement is made. In our case the judgement will be made against how much the software will help to achieve its objective in the most efficient and effective way possible.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    </div>
            <p>In my work I have used Trello and Git Hub to help me with planning tasks and version control.</p>
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>Trello which is used for planning tasks works on a system of cards which you can assign tasks to. Within each task you can add a number of functions such as, assigning team members to a task, adding checklists, adding due dates, adding labels and attachments. These functions are useful however Trello can be quite clumbersome. If you set up a completed card for each task your page will quickly become very busy which makes Trello lose much of its value of being quick and easy to interpret. I use it with a checklist on each task so that you can see each that the task is completed. Due to this there is good reasoning that I should be using Teamwork to plan my tasks. Teamwork has the same functionality but works in a list view, once a task it complete you simply tick that it is completed. Teamwork’s fatal flaw however is that the task disappears after it is completed which could lead to other team members not realising that the task existed or that it has been complete. Due to the chance of the a team member performing the same task after it has been completed. I would recommend Trello for the majority of tasks over many other platforms. </p>
            <h3>Version Control</h3>
            <p>Git Hub is used along with Git and mostly used for computer code. It is a very popular version control platform and for good reason. It is simple and quick to use and offers great distributed version control and source code management. It has several collaboration features such as bug tracking and task management.
            <p>Within Github you create a central repository where all developers on a certain task can keep can keep up with the latest advancements. They can download the latest update, work on the file and then upload the new version to Github without effecting other versions before it. This allows the team to discover where issues have occurred. Github allows flexibility within teams and also for projects to scale efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Legal</h2>
                </div>
                <p>How do legal guidelines and constraints impact digital business?</p>
                <p>This can be answered by looking at the 7 principles of GDPR. GDPR which stands for General Data Protection Regulation is a set of regulations for all EU countries and governed by EU law. They have been created to protect and empower all EU citizen’s data privacy.</p>
                <p>The seven Principles of GDPR are:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
                <li>Purpose limitation</li>
                <li>Data minimisation</li>
                <li>Accuracy</li>
                <li>Storage limitation</li>
                <li>Integrity and confidentiality (security)</li>
                <li>Accountability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These principles can be applied to a business and how it should handle its data. The business should respect the data that it collects being lawful with its use and also transparent with how it will be used before it is even collected. It must make it clear to anyone passing on their data what the purpose is they are using it for. They must not take unnecessary data if they know it will not be used. They must not keep the data for longer than it is needed. They must make sure that the data is kept safe and confidential and are accountable if they do not.</p>
                <p>These regulations have been created to lower the threat of cyber crimes and misuse of digital data. By having these rules with accountability, It creates an environment where anyone who passes on their data is less likely to be a victim of these crimes. Businesses have a larger responsibility to respect the data that they hold and keep it private and protected. Without these regulations being implemented the internet and other places where data is passed on are far less safe, this leads to the internet as a whole having less value due to the cost of cyber crimes and misuse of data.</p>
                <p>These guidelines and constraints effect digital business due to the accountability costs of not following them and customer/stakeholders trust of the business will be affected if they are caught out. This leads to businesses needing to set a structure which makes sure that these guidelines are followed and implemented as they are critical to the business staying within the law and respecting any data that they collect.</p>
