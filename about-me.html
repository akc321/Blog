        <h2>What I know</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
       <p>Around 2003 my brother started Multi Media Technology at University. It was at this time I was first introduced to Photoshop and also CD piracy but the less I talk about that the better. As he brought work home I learned about how to use Photoshop at an early age. I would follow exercises in his workbooks to increase my understanding. I never did any full courses on Photoshop but I learned enough to be able to earn an extra income at university selling poster designs for DJ events.</p>
       <h3>Digital Business Knowledge</h3>
       <p>My course at University was Business Enterprise, within this course many of the modules looked into how IT systems affect modern business. These courses looked into SEO, website design, the effects of social media and digital marketing strategies.</p>
       <h3>Basic Website Design</h3>
       <p>After I finished University I started up my own company selling websites. I gained some knowledge in HTML, CSS and integrating JQeury elements. I also learned some basic SQL.
        My company was selling around 1 website a month which left me with very little to get by each month. It was a very slow process creating websites having to learn everything as I made them. Sadly I did not realise the potential to grow back then as I made on average £800 per website. If I had stuck with website design the speed I could have made website could have gone from one month to one week or less.</p>
       <h3>Real World Business Knowledge</h3>
       <p>About 6 months into my company I took up the opportunity of working for my brother’s kitchen retail company. This would lead to 5 years really getting to grips with how business works and learning everything from admin to making crucial deals with suppliers. It has been a rollercoaster ride with many highs and lows. Within this time I learned how to market the company. I learned organisation skills, self organisation skills. I learned how to keep teams organised, from this list you can tell organisation was pretty important.<br><br>

        I created many systems using excel, I created a large quoting system, management system, task organisation system. I wish I had time to learn a better program for these systems but due to time constraints I had to stick with what I knew. The systems worked and were used for many years but once we grew to a certain point we replaced these with off the shelf software. I take pride that I the replacement software cost several hundred pounds every month which helps show the value of the systems that I created.
