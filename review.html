            <h2>Tools Used - Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The tools which we used on the current project include:</p>
            <h3>Trello</h3>
            <p>Trello is an organisation tool which uses cards with tasks assigned to them. It is very good to use on small projects and small group projects. The issue with Trello is that it can become very convoluted. If you move finished tasks to a global finished tasks card. It can be difficult to figure out how many tasks have been completed from each individual card. If you have a finished task card for each card holding tasks, you will quickly be overwhelmed by the amount of cards that you have. Trello’s value as an organisational tool quickly diminishes due to the difficulty of being able to assess how far you are in the project from viewing the project screen. <br><br>

                Other software such as Teamwork uses a ticked list and has similar functionality to Trello. But it is much simpler to see how far you are with a project as it makes it clear with a better visual depiction and better reporting elements. It also shows how many tasks have been completed against the amount of tasks you began with in a simple line of text. <br><br>
                
                For this project creating a website, Trello has been my preference over Teamwork, if it was a larger website I may change my mind. My organisation space has not become too convoluted and it is clear whether I have completed the task or not. I have adopted an unorthodox approach to using Trello setting a single task checklist on each task. This gives a visual cue on whether the task has been completed or not, without having to move it to a completed card. This makes it simple to see if all the tasks for a given objective have been completed.</p>
            <h3>Code Pen</h3>
            <p>Code Pen is a useful tool for web development, it can give you insight into how a particular feature has been coded. This insight is invaluable when learning how to do something new. Using Code Pen I have been able to understand the theory of how CSS Parallax scroll works, by being able to manipulate the data on the webpage and see instant results, you can get a better understanding of the role each element plays within a function. My only drawback to Code Pen is when using your laptops trackpad or mouse. If you accidentally hit the ‘back’ button or perform the same function using two fingers on the trackpad. You lose all data that you have written. This can be very frustrating especially if you are testing the waters of a function and are unsure how you got to the point that you were at.</p>
            <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
            <p>Visual Studio is a great Integrated development environment, I have been unable to take advantage of the add on functionality but using it in it’s most basic form has helped me to create my website quick and efficiently. The colour scheme aids with differentiating the different types of information. Whether it be a variable, function, object, array or any other element. It makes it simple to see what you are doing due to a beneficial colour scheme.<br><br>

                The Intellisense feature is very useful especially as a beginner to coding. It allows for mistakes to be easily seen so that they can be corrected. I also like the indent feature which displays a vertical line, on this project it has helped to make my containers easy to understand, as you can see exactly what is within them due to the vertical line stating at the start of a div tag and ending at the closure of the div tag (or any tag you wish to use).</p>

            <h2>Appropriateness of tools used</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Trello</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, Trello is good for smaller projects, due to this project being quite small it was very useful for organising the project and being able to see my progress with a quick look at the screen. The added features on Trello were useful to show if I had completed a task. I decided against using checklists (with multiple tasks) within tasks as you can not get a very good visual representation of these looking at the task on the whole. As you have to click into each individual task to see the tasks that have been set. I believe that Trello was the best tool to my knowledge for this task.</p>
            <h3>Code Pen</h3>
            <p>Code Pen was extremely useful for creating this website, There were many times that I needed to understand how a piece of code worked. By getting this understanding quickly by looking at other examples, I was delayed less and able to continue the creation of my website.</p>
            <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
            <p>Visual studio helped me to code my website efficiently and effectively, I was able to code my website very cleanly and be able to understand the data better by the colour scheme that Visual Studio displays. Along with Intellisense I was able to code with less unnecessary bugs due to input errors.</p>

            <h2>Strengths and weaknesses of my final project</h2>
            </div>
           
            <h3>Let's talk about strengths first</h3>
            <p>In my eyes the website looks professional and I have kept a uniform colour scheme throughout. I have added a home page which is aesthetically pleasing and can direct the user to my “blog” or “about me” page.</p>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>The website indicates which page the user is on in the navigation by highlighting the tab which correlates with the current page. I have also added a hover function which highlights the tab which is being hovered over. It even has a delay function on this hover function so that a gradual change from unhighlighted to highlighted occurs. This effect looks professional and is appealing to the eye.</p>
            <h3>Use of classes</h3>
            <p>Adding a class to all elements makes it simple to add elements as you only need to make changes to the HTML.</p>
            <h3>Image use</h3>
            <p>I have used images well, selecting good images can be the make or break factor for a website. I selected images which suit the colour theme of Yellow and Black. This helps to add a uniformity to the website and increase its aesthetic appeal. Note: I am unhappy with the images on the “About Me” page as I believe they look unprofessional.</p>
            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>The last item that I am pleased about is keeping my website responsive allowing it to work on various sized screens. I am especially proud of the home screen and keeping the text within a certain area of the background image using Flexbox.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Now let's talk about the weaknesses</h3>
            <p>Due to time constraints and knowledge gaps I was unable to discover and integrate features which I know are common on other websites.</p>
            <h3>Duplicate data - Navigation</h3>
            <p>The first area that I would improve would be using javascript to display the navigation menu. Though I know how to add the menu with Javascript, I struggled to keep it’s functionality so I decided not to use javascript and instead to repeat the code on each HTML page.</p>
            <h3>About Me page look</h3>
            <p>The look of the “About me” page is unprofessional. I would like to add a picture of myself to the page and improve the look of the typography and the container it is within. The typography and container look too simple. Possibly adding a radius to the boxes may make them look more modern. <strong><u>EDIT</u> -</strong> After writing this paragraph I decided to add a radius due to how simple it was to do.</p>
            <h3>No Javascript</h3>
            <p>I would have like to add some javascript functionality, integrating javascript in the website I would have been able to add nice features. Features such as slide shows, making it simpler to move through blog posts. I would have been able to add a comments section so that I can get the opinions of people who view my blog. I also would have been also able to create an interactive experience guiding the user down the path I want them to take through my website. </p>

            <h2>Improvements which can be made</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The improvements that I would like to make to my website are as follows:</p>
            
            <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>Follow industry standards for typography and improve the look of the website.</p>
                <h3>Clean up code</h3>
                <p>Clean up my HTML and CSS code, I definitely have room for improvement indenting and organising my code.</p>
                <h3>Remove duplicate code</h3>
                <p>Using javascript for my navigation menu and footer. I currently have to duplicate code on each HTML page for these items. This means that if there are any changes that I will have to make, I will have to make the change on every page. It would be better if I could make the change once and it would change on every page. I could simply take the code required to do this from Code Pen. But I would prefer to learn how to create the code myself before using it on my site. </p>
                <h3>Add scroll feature</h3>
                <p>By adding a scroll feature using javascript I could help the user better navigate the blog page.</p>
                <h3>Professional image use</h3>
                <p>Adding an image better suited to the “About Me” page, such as an image of myself.</p>
                <h3>Flex Box</h3>
                <p>Better use of Flex box to improve how content is organised.</p>
                <h3>Page loading times</h3>
                <p>Load times of images could be decreased to improve the time it takes for the page to display. This can be done by storing images in the root folder and not as a link. Setting the size of images so that they are not excessively large and also creating specific images, with a specific dat size, for specific sizes of screen will also help to improve the display speed.</p>
                <h3>Page longevity</h3>
                <p>Removing external links for images and saving the images to the root folder to make sure that changes on external sites do not affect my website. A change on a website where my image comes from could mean that a completely different image is shown on my site or more likely no image is shown at all as it will become a broken link.</p>

            <h2>Productivity, efficiency and teams</h2>
            </div>
            <p>On this project we performed our work as individuals. This meant that the methods for maintaining productivity and efficiency are very different in my eyes to the methods that you would use when working in a team. <br><br>

                When working on your own with the knowledge that you will not have to work in a team at any point. There are many shortcuts that you can take to improve efficiency. Such shortcuts include not having to set times on tasks to be completed for every task. This is especially true on small projects. This is due to the time it takes to set these times on each task against how much it will benefit you being nominal. You should try to only start a task when another task is complete so setting times on every task may not be effective as you may complete a task early. This is true for a team as well but by setting times for them to complete a task, you can make sure that you are working in unison and starting tasks without the information you need to complete a task.<br><br>
                
                Note: I do not believe an app exists which lets you set a time each task will take and once you have marked it as completed, will let you know if you are in front or behind in your project. An app like this would work for both individuals and teams and make sure that you are performing your task on time without having to reset when to start tasks and when they need to be completed.</p>
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>One of the main differences between working as an individual and working in a team is communication. When defining a task it is crucial to understand the availability of the team and the skills that the team have. This allows you to properly delegate tasks to individuals by skills that they posses.</p>
            <h3>Visual Communication</h3>
            <p>Another crucial part of communication within teams is displaying when tasks have been completed. This can be as simple as moving a task on to a complete card in Trello or marking it as complete using the checklist function on Trello. This allows the team to know how far you are into the task, so that they can perform tasks when they are required to. Some tasks require other tasks to be completed before they can start. By adding reminders on Trello and also setting reminders this can be done.</p>
            <h3>Meetings</h3>
            <p>If working in a team I would not just rely on Trello to organise the team. By having small meetings, it will make sure people properly understand what they are doing and whether they are keeping on top of it. This will make sure that people do not become demotivated or unsure of their role within the project.</p>
            <h3>Informing Team Members Of Issues</h3>
            <p>Using Trello or another form of communication we can inform team members of issues as they happen. Depending on the severity of the issue a decision can be made whether to take team members away from there set task to help on the issue or whether to have an emergency meeting on ways to solve the issue. An issue can effect the whole project, so by communicating the issue to the team, it can be dealt with properly so that it has minimal effect on the project.</p>
            <h3>Team work</h3>
            <p>If I was to complete this project in a team, I would have assigned tasks to each individual. I would have assigned the task of creating the content to one or many individuals depending on the size of my team. Each would have their own section of the content to research and complete, this would be organised on Trello so that every member would understand what their task is and what other team members tasks are too.<br><br>

                I would set another individual with the task of creating the style of the website using dummy HTML data at first as the HTML content would not be available straight away.<br><br>
                
                I would organise the project making sure all team members are happy and motivated. I would make sure the team were using AGILE practices. I would keep a track on members using Trello and also by speaking to them and getting a better understanding of their ideas. This would allow me to give them direction if I believe what they are doing is moving away from the objective of the project.<br><br>
                
                I would then research how to make the project better in my spare time. Depending on the time set we could implement improvements once properly researched and the benefits of implementing outweigh the drawbacks of the time it takes to implement. This is all theoretical however as how I would approach the task would depend on the size of the team and the time limit set. I would use this approach above if we had a team of 3+ and if we had the time limit we currently have set.</p>

            <h2>Ways To Improve Productivity And Efficiency</h2>
            </div>
            <p>To improve productivity and efficiency, I believe that planning is crucial and the amount of time you spend on planning is crucial. It will always depend on the task size and the time you have to complete that task. If the project is small there is no point in spending excessive time on planning. If your brain can compute the limited amount of tasks on the project you may not need to plan at all. It would be more efficient to dive straight into the project and start creating. However if a project has more than 4 or 5 small tasks I would advise to make a plan. </p>
            <h3>Why plans are effective</h3>
            <p>Creating a plan is useful for many reasons. If it is a plan to do with a project which you have a strong emotional connection to, It will move these ideas to the analytical part of the brain. This will be done by writing out a plan on either a web app such as Trello or if you put it on paper. Losing this emotion allows for better rational decisions to me made based on the specifics of the project.<br><br>

                Putting a plan on Trello can help for the project to be organised and kept on top of. If someone was falling behind or has missed a task, this can be seen and rectified depending on how the team leader wishes to deal with the issue.</p>

            <h2>Testing digital solutions</h2>
            </div>
            <p>On my site there have been limited tests that I have had to perform, this is due to only using CSS and HTML.</p>
            <h3>Trial and Error</h3>
            <p>When creating the functionality of the responsive layout I had to use trial and error to see if the webpage responded the way that I expected. I have contorted the browser size to every possible ratio to see if my site worked responsively. I could further this testing by using the website on different devices and browsers. I can check that my website works on different browsers currently but I will need to upload the website to a server to check if it works on my phone and tablet devices.</p>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>User testing is very useful as the tester can use your website in a different manner to which you would use it and give you feedback that is unexpected. As the website is going to have an end user the ideal solution would be to get the end user to test the website itself. Due to this being a course project, this will not be possible on this occasion.</p>
            <h3>Unit testing</h3>
            <p>After completing each section of my site I have been testing and reviewing that section before moving on to the next section</p>
            <h3>Performance testing</h3>
            <p>For every element which is not static I have been testing whether the elements work properly with the elements around them. This issue was apparent on the index page where I had to keep the text and buttons with a container in a specific area of the container. I finally achieved this using Flex Box but I used lots of trial and error before I came across this solution.</p>
           
        </div>

        <div class="blogEntry">
            <div class="blog-head">
            <h2>Content and layout of pages</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Home Page</h3>
            <p>I have created a simple homepage which looks aesthetically pleasing, I have done this by setting the background image to have a 100% view height. I have used flex box to ensure that the content within that container stays within a certain area of the image as it does not look as appealing when it falls out of that area. I had to trial and error solutions to get this to work exactly as I wanted it to. This included setting font and button sizes in proportion to the size of the screen. I have added two links which take the user to either the “About Me’ page or the “Blog Page”. I have made the home button look as though it is highlighted and added a hover function which highlights the buttons when the cursor is over the top of it. I have added this functionality to the home page button also just to show the user that it is still a button. I have also added a delay to the buttons becoming highlighted as it is an aesthetically pleasing effect.<br><br>


                I have added a simple footer to this page which has a simple navigation function.</p>
            <h3>About Me Page</h3>
            <p>I have created this page with the same format as the Blog and the Review page. It has a navigation bar at the top of the screen, I have made it so that the navigation bar shows which page the website is currently on, by having that navigation tab highlighted. I then have added extra functionality so that the tab which the cursor is above will become highlighted so that the user understands that the item will be selected if they click on that navigation element. I have also added a delay to the navigation button becoming highlighted as it is an aesthetically pleasing effect.<br><br>

                The page has the the content positioned centrally and starts with the title of the page and then an image. I decided against full width content for this page as I did not have the images to suit a full page layout. Due to the content of the page I decided against splitting the page into different columns, preferring a single column to display my content.<br><br>
                
                In this section I explain my decision behind wanting to become a software programmer and the knowledge that I already have.<br><br>
                
                Similar to the home page and every other page, I have added a simple footer which has a simple navigation function.</p>
            <h3>Blog Page</h3>
            <p>My Blog page follows the same structure as the about me page, on the blog page I look into the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Purpose of IT in modern business</li>
                <li>Methods & skills for a digital project</li>

                <li>Legal</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>This page also has a footer the same as the other pages.</p>
            <h3>Review Page</h3>
            <p>My Review page follows the same structure as the “About Me” and “Blog” page, on the review page I review the following areas of my final project:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Tools used, benefits and drawbacks</li>

            <h2>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

            <p>Within my website I have had to use content which has not been created by myself. On this project I have used my original code and all text has been written myself. I have however used images from other websites which I did not create. These images have a creative commons license and have been made free to use by the creator of the image.<br><br>

                If an image was licensed it should not be used on any site without consent as there can be fines to pay no matter what the site is being used for.</p>
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>All of my text has been entered into the code of the website and not through images. This allows tools such as google translate. To change the text on my site to the relevant language.</p>
            <h3>Screen Size</h3>
            <p>I have made my site to be responsive and adjust to screen size. Modern websites need to adjust to the screen size of the device they are being viewed on and for when the user wishes to change the browser size on their desktop. I could improve my site by better using Flex Box so that my site works better on smaller devices. It could also be improved by setting a specific style sheets depending on the size of the device.</p>

            <h2>Access issues</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Due to the length of time I had to create my website, I have not added any features to aid people with disabilities to use my site.</p>
            <h3>Deaf accessibility</h3>
            <p>My site does not have any sounds so I did not have to add any further text descriptions of the noises on the site or add subtitles to any videos or audio.</p>
            <h3>Partially Blind Accessibility</h3>
            <p>My sites font has been made a good readable size for all device sizes. If a partially blind person was to use my site, due to all of the text being coded into the site, they could increase the size of the website using browser functionality. This would increase the size of the font so that the website is easier to read.</p>
            <h3>Blind Accessibility</h3>
            <p>I have not added any image tags which explain what the image is depicting. If I did it would aid blind users by letting them know what the image is.<br><br>

                The website can be used with ease using just the computer keyboard. Each link can easily be selected using the tab key. There has been no need to take away any of the links that it tabs to due to them not being useful. The order that it tabs between links has also not had to be changed due to the natural flow of the web pages.</p>
